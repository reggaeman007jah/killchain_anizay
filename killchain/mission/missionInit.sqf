Plan:
Create points to patrol based on mission-placed markers - this gives mission-maker control without needing to open a script  

Mission Marker names are as follows: 
killchainObj1, killchainObj1, killchainObj1, killchainObj1, killchainObj1, killchainObj1, killchainFinal

to-do:
Replace:
// ONEPOINT = false;
// TWOPOINT = false;
// THREEPOINT = false;
System with more simple system
