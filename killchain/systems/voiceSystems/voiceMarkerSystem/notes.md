Voice Activated Visual Marker System (VA-VMS) by Reggaeman
v.01 May 2020

Notes:
This system will enable a player to use VA to create a temp global marker using voice commands
Essentially this will be a spotting tool for faction and types (e.g, opfor infi, blufor tanks, repair spots etc)
Will be based on marker category, marker type, distance and lookDir
e.g. opfor infantry 300m (+ look direction)
e.g. fire mission 1 klick (+ look direction)
e.g. set up a repair signal on my location
Markers are temporary - they fde out and then get deleted
System feedback is to confirm this to all units (though remoteExec systChat for now)
If this is a mistake in marker placement, for now, tough, let it expire and tell your units about your mistake
consider breaking out the general markers into a totally different flow

consider:
decide on audio alerts to players (.ogg or within VA)
creating separate J-TAC system for more exact relay of fire strikes, direction, repair, pickup etc

toDo:
check whether all EHs are needed (cancel?)
complete cancel operation
enable a delete option while in map - for any player
enable system to show other info like "attack here", "move there" or "this direction"
enable "infi moving" + direction arrow
enable an "on my location" command for pickups
add player name to marker intel or alerts somehow
add custom radio channel for colour in sysChat

done:
enable multiple markers at once!

partly done (but needs more work if demand is there):
global alerts to MP players (see colour and custom radio chat)

current issues:

fixed issues:
general category is bugged (process trips before confirmation is made) and also does not show correct menu in systemChat
Removed the general selection - will be done separately to keep things focussed on rapid heli-observations
